# This is a strating of react learning

# It starts from installing the node modules to execute the code via command "npx parcel index.html" 

# initially create the dev dependencies, then install the React and RecatDOM via command "npm install react" and "npm install react-dom" respectively. 

# let me put the command in a synchronized layer :- 

# 1. "npm init"  ---------> it creates a package and contains and manage all the details for fothcomings, after entering, fill all the necessary details of your particular project. after entering - a package.json will be create which is a configuration of npm.
# 2. to intall a parcel (dependency) as a bundler - 
# "npm install parcel" ----------> this command used for normal dependency.
# "npm install -D parcel" -----------> this command used for development or production, also known as dev dependency 
# Now, after entering the above command, a package-lock.json will show in your folder which is very imp to your project or work. 
# NOTE: create a " .gitignore" and put node modules and lock.json file over there, (1) we can easily recreate it by one command, (2) no need to commit all the modules and data into your github (3) we can install or modules easily from the node libraries.
# last but not least ---> install React and ReactDOM by "npm install react" and "npm install react-dom" respectively. 

# AND execute your code by "npx parcel index.html"
